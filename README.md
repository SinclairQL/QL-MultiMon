# QL-MultiMon
A Machine code monitor and disassembler for the Sinclair QL, originally written in 1986-87. Manual updated February 2017.

Issues solved in v3.00 beta:

- Addresses now have full 32-bit display (dynamically using 4 to 8 hex digits)
- Workaround for uQLx bug in SCR/CON open procedure which led to all windows overlapping each other!
- Removed dependency on fixed system variables address - useful when you use Minerva's second screen.

Please note that this is a BETA version and still being worked on. Bug reports and enhancement requests are welcome...
